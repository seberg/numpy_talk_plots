This repository holds scripts (and some similar tries for plots) for Ralf Gommers
talk at SciPy 2019 "Inside NumPy: Preparing for the Next Decade".

The commit plots are based on querying `git` directly, and you will have to change
the path to whichever git repository you wish to query (the BIDS people/times are
hardcoded though).

The issue/PR data is based on data collected by Nelle Varoquaux (it does query the
github API for informatio on whether a PR was done against master). Thus for your
own project (or to recreate the plots) you need to fetch the data yourself.
(For some plots, the last data point may have been extrapolated).

The `other_plots` folder contains other tries that were not used in the talk
and may not actually be finished or correct.
